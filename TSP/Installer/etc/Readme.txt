Sentinel Technical Supervisor - Version 1.8 was installed   WIP
=========================================================

Technical Supervisor is a tool for monitoring a managed Sentinel Record system. The tool is designed to be run from the desktop or program folder short-cuts.

When Technical Supervisor first starts, it will prompt for an XML site configuration file. These files will be supplied by Thruput.

If a new XML config file has been provided, then this can be loaded using the "Load Config" short-cut created within the Windows Start menu.

Please refer to the Technical Supervisor documentation provided by Thruput for details on how to configure the software.
